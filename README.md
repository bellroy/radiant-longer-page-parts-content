radiant-longer-page-parts-content
=================================

Makes the page parts content bigger in the datase. If you find radiant is truncating your page, it's probably because the database can't hold all the content. Adding this extension should fix that.

```
rake radiant:extensions:longer-page-parts-content:migrate
```
